1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
People can develop these patterns of behavior

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,280
that are destructive with anything

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,920
whether it's with alcohol or cannabis

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,000
or sex or anything

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,080
people get

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,920
they get in ruts

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,800
and

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,640
it doesn't mean

9
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,840
that the cannabis is bad

10
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,040
it means that you are on a bad mental path

11
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,880
Yes

12
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,720
Exactly

13
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,560
I mean

14
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,520
I'm not encouraging it for everybody

15
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,280
because some people

16
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,120
generally

17
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,800
biologically

18
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,160
doesn't

19
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,920
jive with them

20
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,760
Yeah

21
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,360
But

22
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,560
the fundamental thing is

23
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,000
we as adult human beings

24
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,200
need to take responsibility

25
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
for our own lives

26
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,640
and our own decisions

27
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,800
and we need not

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,080
hand

29
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,960
that responsibility

30
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,240

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,200

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,720
something as

00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,360
intimate

37
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,080
